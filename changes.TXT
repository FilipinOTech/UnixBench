# 3/89 - Ben Smith - BYTE: globalized many variables, modernized syntax
# 5/89 - commented and modernized. Removed workload items till they
#        have been modernized. Added database server test.
# 11/14/89 - Made modifications to reflect new version of fstime
#        and elimination of mem tests.
# 10/22/90 - Many tests have been flipped so that they run for
#        a specified length of time and loops are counted.

# 1997.09.10    DCN     Added perlbench as an Exhibition benchmark
# 1997.09.23    DCN     Added rgooch's select as an Exhibition benchmark
# 1999.07.28    DCN     "select" not compiled or run by default, because it
#                       does not compile on many platforms.  PerlBench also
#                       not run by default.
